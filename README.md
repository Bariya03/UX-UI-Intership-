## DESCRIPTION OF TASK 1 - 
Redesign of an Insurance Website Landing Page

As part of my internship project, I was assigned the task of redesigning a landing page for an insurance company to improve its visual appeal, user experience (UX), and overall usability. The primary goal was to enhance the clarity, trustworthiness, and user engagement of the site while maintaining a professional yet friendly tone, suitable for the insurance domain.

The page I redesigned was for RNG Life, a life insurance service provider. I focused on modernizing the layout and visual elements, improving content hierarchy, and emphasizing key selling points such as reliability, transparency, and ease of use. The new landing page aims to not only look aesthetically appealing but also be functional, accessible, and conversion-optimized.

Key Enhancements and Design Features:

	1.	Hero Section (Top Banner):
I redesigned the hero section with a clean, modern look that instantly communicates the purpose of the site—life insurance. The illustration of a cyclist next to a road safety sign makes the theme approachable and human-centered. The call-to-action (CTA) button “Apply Now” is prominently placed beside a simplified email input field to encourage immediate user action. The typography is clear and bold, focusing on the headline “Life insurance that does more.”
	2.	Impactful Statistics Section:
Directly beneath the hero section, I added a statistics bar showing key figures like “2.5M Paid out,” “4.9★ Google score,” and “95% Claims paid out.” These numbers are visually emphasized to immediately build user trust and convey company credibility through social proof and factual data.
	3.	Features Section:
The “Plan Features” area outlines the three major benefits of the service: Protection, Benefit, and Coverage. Each feature is supported with an icon for easy recognition and faster scanning. The right side includes an emotional, human-touch image to keep the content relatable.
	4.	Why We Are Different Section:
This section highlights the brand’s unique selling points such as “Get your money back,” “We approve more,” and “More complete protection.” Custom illustrations make the messaging more engaging and less corporate, appealing to users across age groups.
	5.	Testimonials Section:
Client testimonials add authenticity and credibility. I presented them using circular user photos and a short quote from a customer named Ruth. This section is important for social proof and trust-building, especially in the insurance domain.
	6.	Final CTA Section:
At the bottom of the page, I added a bold and inviting CTA with the text: “Better coverage is just a click away.” This final push encourages users to start their insurance journey with a simple button labeled “Get Started.”

Tools & Design Principles Used:

	•	Tools: Figma
	•	Principles: Visual hierarchy, contrast, accessibility, responsive design, user-centered design, and consistency.

## DESCRIPTION OF TASK 2 - 
Responsive Design Implementation for a Tech Product Landing Page

As part of my internship project focused on UX/UI design, my second task was to implement a responsive design for a technology-based e-commerce website. The goal was to ensure optimal user experience across all major screen sizes, including desktop (wide and standard), tablet, and mobile devices. For this task, I worked on a landing page redesign for Insight, a platform that offers a wide range of IT products and solutions, such as laptops, software, and accessories.

This task was aimed at strengthening my skills in responsive layout creation, adaptive content scaling, and consistent UI design across devices. It involved understanding layout principles, maintaining design integrity, and ensuring content accessibility at every screen resolution.

Key Focus Areas and Implementation Steps:

	1.	Desktop View (1792px and 1440px):
I started with the full-width desktop version, where I structured the content using a flexible grid system. I made sure to preserve white space, consistent margins, and balanced visual hierarchy. Key sections included:
	•	Hero banner featuring the MacBook Air as a promoted product
	•	Clear CTAs like “Shop Now,” “Request a Quote,” and “Shop our Products”
	•	Product category icons for easier navigation
	•	Featured Deals section with uniform product cards
	•	Brand logos to establish credibility
	2.	Tablet View:
For the tablet screen, I adapted the layout using breakpoints to stack and realign elements for easier vertical scrolling. Content sections that appeared side-by-side on desktop were now presented in a single column format, ensuring touch-friendly button sizes, legible text, and easy tap navigation. Visual elements were slightly scaled down without affecting clarity or impact.
	3.	Mobile View (iPhone Size):
On mobile, the design had to be the most compact yet highly readable. The hamburger menu replaced the full header navigation. The hero banner and product information were resized and stacked to support thumb navigation. Icons and buttons were optimized for touch input, and horizontal scrolling was completely avoided. Product cards were converted into single-column layouts to maintain focus and avoid clutter.

Tools and Technologies Used:

	•	Tools: Figma 
	•	Design Framework: Responsive grid systems
	•	Breakpoints Considered: 1792px, 1440px, 768px (tablet), and 375px (mobile)

## DESCRIPTION OF TASK 3 - 
Redesigning Rapido


Pain Points - 1. Lack of User Engagement: The first paramount of an application is the look and feel. In my opinion, the original app is not very accurately designed in terms of UI, as the prominent features aren’t easily accessible and the application lacked minimalism which people are looking for i.e., a simple interface to interact with. The application lacked the finesse to be precise.
2. Flexibility and efficiency of use: Novice users can easily book a bike in the default manner; however, an experienced user would want to set up preferences by entering a default payment type or save frequently visited places like work or the gym.
3. Visibility of system status: When users make a booking, the system does not do a good job of informing the users about what is going on:
— ETA is displayed before the booking has been made, which isn’t precise.
— When a booking has been confirmed, the OTP isn’t legible because of the placement.
4. Aesthetics and Visual appeal: The interface violates certain aspects of design, from the misaligned placement of texts to visual aesthetics. The design takes on an outdated look, which could be improved.

Identifying the weaknesses
· Too many options in Cluttered Menu
· No option to schedule rides in advance
· No option to deliver packages
· Lagging Animations
· Promos / CTAs (Call to action) densely populated across the entire application

## DESCRIPTION OF TASK 4 - 

The goal of Task 4 was to design an intuitive and visually engaging user interface for an AR/VR application. The submitted interface focuses on immersive interaction, clarity, and ease of navigation, aligned with the design principles necessary for AR/VR platforms.

✅ How the Interface Meets AR/VR Design Goals:

	1.	Intuitive Interactions:
	•	Users are guided visually through clean, bold CTA buttons like “TRY NOW” and “Learn More.”
	•	Interactive hotspots around the VR headset draw attention to product features, simulating real-world interaction.
	2.	Immersive Visual Appeal:
	•	A futuristic color palette (purple gradients, neon highlights) reinforces the sci-fi and immersive nature of VR.
	•	Use of 3D imagery and device close-ups gives users a hands-on feel, enhancing virtual realism.
	3.	User-Centric Layout:
	•	Clean navigation (About Us, Product, Features, Services) is placed prominently, allowing easy access across sections.
	•	Key metrics like “500k+ Active Users” and “100k+ Positive Reviews” build user trust and provide instant social proof.
	4.	Accessibility & Feedback:
	•	UI includes platform icons (Apple, Windows, Huawei) to show compatibility.
	•	Clear, minimal typography ensures legibility within a visually intense experience.
	5.	Modular & Scalable:
	•	Cards and sections (e.g., Our Services, About Vear) allow for easy scalability of new content or updates.

🧩 Conclusion:

This AR/VR interface combines clarity, immersion, and intuitive flow, achieving a user-friendly design that meets modern expectations in virtual technology. It invites users to explore, engage, and trust the platform — all key goals in effective AR/VR design.
