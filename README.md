## DESCRIPTION OF TASK 1 - 
As part of my internship project, I was assigned the task of redesigning a landing page for an insurance company to improve its visual appeal, user experience (UX), and overall usability. The primary goal was to enhance the clarity, trustworthiness, and user engagement of the site while maintaining a professional yet friendly tone, suitable for the insurance domain.

The page I redesigned was for RNG Life, a life insurance service provider. I focused on modernizing the layout and visual elements, improving content hierarchy, and emphasizing key selling points such as reliability, transparency, and ease of use. The new landing page aims to not only look aesthetically appealing but also be functional, accessible, and conversion-optimized.

Key Enhancements and Design Features:

	1.	Hero Section (Top Banner):
I redesigned the hero section with a clean, modern look that instantly communicates the purpose of the site—life insurance. The illustration of a cyclist next to a road safety sign makes the theme approachable and human-centered. The call-to-action (CTA) button “Apply Now” is prominently placed beside a simplified email input field to encourage immediate user action. The typography is clear and bold, focusing on the headline “Life insurance that does more.”
	2.	Impactful Statistics Section:
Directly beneath the hero section, I added a statistics bar showing key figures like “2.5M Paid out,” “4.9★ Google score,” and “95% Claims paid out.” These numbers are visually emphasized to immediately build user trust and convey company credibility through social proof and factual data.
	3.	Features Section:
The “Plan Features” area outlines the three major benefits of the service: Protection, Benefit, and Coverage. Each feature is supported with an icon for easy recognition and faster scanning. The right side includes an emotional, human-touch image to keep the content relatable.
	4.	Why We Are Different Section:
This section highlights the brand’s unique selling points such as “Get your money back,” “We approve more,” and “More complete protection.” Custom illustrations make the messaging more engaging and less corporate, appealing to users across age groups.
	5.	Testimonials Section:
Client testimonials add authenticity and credibility. I presented them using circular user photos and a short quote from a customer named Ruth. This section is important for social proof and trust-building, especially in the insurance domain.
	6.	Final CTA Section:
At the bottom of the page, I added a bold and inviting CTA with the text: “Better coverage is just a click away.” This final push encourages users to start their insurance journey with a simple button labeled “Get Started.”

Tools & Design Principles Used:

	•	Tools: Figma, Adobe XD (or any other used)
	•	Principles: Visual hierarchy, contrast, accessibility, responsive design, user-centered design, and consistency.
